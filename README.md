![App preview](https://github.com/AnnaCheba/shares-manager/blob/master/2017-10-25%2013.25.40.jpg)

### For implementing this App I used:

- ReactJS
- Yahoo’s finance API (to load Stock data)
- localStorage (to save input data after refresh page)


### This app has next functionality:

- Add or remove amounts to cash balance, which is then used for buying shares.
- Execute “buy” or “sell” orders for a quantity of stock. 
- Current cash and shareholdings are visible to the user.


### For tun app need run in console in root folder:

`$ brew install yarn`

`$ yarn install`

`$ yarn start`
