# Shares Manager
App fore fake manage Stock Shares. 

For implementing this App I used:

- ReactJS
- Yahoo’s finance API (to load Stock data)
- localStorage (to save input data after refresh page)


This app have next functionality:

- Add or remove amounts to cash balance, which is then used for buying shares.
- Execute “buy” or “sell” orders for a quantity of stock. 
- Current cash and share holdings are visible to the user.


For tun app need run in console in root folder:

$ brew install yarn

$ yarn install

$ yarn start
